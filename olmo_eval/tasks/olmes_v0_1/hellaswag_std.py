HellaSwag: Can a Machine Really Finish Your Sentence?
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07830.pdf

Hellaswag is a commonsense inference challenge dataset. Though its questions are
trivial for humans (>95% accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle (<48%). This is
achieved via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a
series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated
wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up
the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical 'Goldilocks'
zone wherein generated text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by
state-of-the-art models.

    # Choose the best continuation:
    #  A. If you have small gaps between your teeth, a thicker floss might work fine. You should also avoid super floss, as it'll damage the fine plastic coating of your teeth.
    #  B. Choosing a thicker floss will help ensure that you are actually flossing all the surfaces of your teeth and makes flossing easier. You'll know you have gaps if a normal dental floss slides in very easily, and you see ample space around it.
    #  C. However, since dental floss is so wide and heavy, you'll need to pick a thinner one which is less brittle than regular dental floss. If your mouth has a very narrow gap between your teeth and your gums, choose an extra floss.
    #  D. You can pick between super and super thick floss with two or four slits in the end to allow blood to be expelled. Weigh your dental floss before you purchase it so you know how much dental floss you'll need.
    # Answer: B
